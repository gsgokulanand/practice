This epic is to enable the setup and deployment of SSO Transaction Monitoring (TM) scenarios for Egypt (EG) and Saudi Arabia (SA) within the ECM (Enterprise Case Management) platform.

As part of this implementation, necessary configurations, integrations, and validations need to be completed in ECM to support country-specific TM alerts investigation and case management workflows.

The scope includes:
	•	Creation of country-specific case queues/routing rules
	•	Configuration of user roles and access rights
	•	Integration with MANTAS/Quantexa for TM alert ingestion
	•	Support for BAU readiness and UAT activities
	•	Validation of alert generation and case creation for both EG and SA

This Epic is critical to support compliance and regulatory reporting requirements as part of the regional TM rollout plan for 2025.
