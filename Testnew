Story:
As an Investigator / ECM User, I want the invalid data (rejected records) to be sent from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring to ECM, so that the correct number of processed records is logged for transparency and tracking.

Additional Description:
	•	The processing report in ECM must display the number of records passed, failed, and reasons for any rejected records.
	•	ECM should track the last successful update count when receiving completed files from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring.
	•	This ensures that ECM users can validate completeness of each batch and identify gaps, if any.

As an ECM User, I want ECM to receive and store Data Quality (DQ) check results from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring, so that DQ validations are tracked for each case and reviewed if required.

Additional Description:
	•	ECM must display DQ results from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring for relevant cases.
	•	DQ scores should include checks on record count, data match, and auto-task mapping.
	•	These values must be pushed into ECM and tagged to cases for easy analysis.
	•	The existing DQ logic must align with Data Quality Management standards.

Story:
As an ECM User, I want ECM to automatically receive scoring data and context from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring for all relevant cases, so that the right events are scored correctly and consistently.

Additional Description:

	•	This includes case details, scoring breakdown, contributing rules, and task mappings.
	•	ECM must also support full automation of case creation, if scoring is available.
	•	The system should handle different scoring cycles (daily, weekly, etc.) and allow backtesting for validation.

	•	Performance of scoring logic
	•	Rule-level impact on efficiency and effectiveness
	•	Backtesting sample success rates
	•	Helps stakeholders evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the contextual monitoring engine.
