	•	Events from the pilot market should be validated for correct holdback timing and flow.
	•	No data loss or duplication should occur during the holdback and release process.

2. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Integration to Transfer Scored Events from Quantexa to ECM

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Scored events must be transmitted in batches to ECM pre-case layer with all required fields.
	•	Every batch should include a reconciliation count that matches between Quantexa and ECM.
	•	Events must include description, score, rules triggered, and case identifiers.

3. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Data Feed from ECM to Quantexa

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	ECM must successfully send daily feed batches with expected format and data completeness.
	•	Quantexa must ingest and log received records with batch tracking.
	•	Reconciliation report should validate the number of records sent vs. received.

4. TM_Contextual Monitoring: DQ Stage 1 – ECM to Quantexa

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Pre-defined DQ rules (null checks, field format validation, value range) must run on incoming ECM data.
	•	Rejected records must be logged with error messages.
	•	Reconciliation report must highlight number of passed/failed records.

5. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Transferring Task IDs from Quantexa to ECM

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Task ID must be created and assigned in ECM for each event from Quantexa.
	•	Task ID mapping should be validated in ECM UI and backend logs.
	•	Batch-level reporting must include Task ID reconciliation between both systems.

6. TM_Contextual Monitoring: DQ Stage 2 – Quantexa to ECM

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	DQ checks must validate final payload after scoring but before ECM ingestion.
	•	Any rejected or failed records must be logged and not passed to ECM.
	•	Reports must compare expected vs. actual event counts post-DQ.

7. TM_Contextual Monitoring: ECM UI Changes to Add Task IDs

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	UI must display task IDs against all relevant ECM cases.
	•	Task ID must be visible, searchable, and correctly mapped.
	•	UI changes should be tested for responsiveness and access control.

8. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Case Creation & Assignment in ECM

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	ECM must automatically create cases from Quantexa high-risk scores.
	•	Analyst assignment logic should follow defined rules (region, team, load).
	•	Each case must reflect associated event metadata and links to source systems.

9. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Case Review & Decision Making

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Workflow states (Open, In Review, Closed, Escalated) must be implemented and navigable.
	•	Analysts must be able to add comments, escalate cases, and record decisions.
	•	ECM should log timestamps and user actions for audit purposes.

10. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Regulatory Reporting & Audit Logs

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Audit logs must capture actions taken by analysts and system events.
	•	ECM must support generation of reports (e.g., SARs) in regulator-approved formats.
	•	Investigation data must be timestamped, complete, and exportable when required.
