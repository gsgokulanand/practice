Line Item 6 — STORY 8000143

Story:
As an Investigator / ECM User, I want the invalid data (rejected records) to be sent from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring to ECM, so that the correct number of processed records is logged for transparency and tracking.

Additional Description:
	•	The processing report in ECM must display the number of records passed, failed, and the reasons for rejected records.
	•	ECM should track the last update point after receiving the complete file from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring.
	•	This helps in identifying if any data is missing and ensures completeness of ingestion.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Processing report must show the number of records passed, failed, and failure reasons.
	•	The invalid data should move to FCC LA Contextual Monitoring.

Story:
As an ECM User, I want ECM to receive and store Data Quality (DQ) check results from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring, so that data validation checks are transparent and auditable for all cases.

Additional Description:
	•	DQ checks should include validation on record count, duplication, scoring logic, and mapping integrity.
	•	These results should be tagged to individual ECM cases.
	•	Quantexa should also display this DQ status under relevant fields.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	ECM should be enhanced to store DQ results received from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring for each case.
	•	DQ checks must include all predefined validation rules and scoring logic checks.

Story:
As an ECM User, I want ECM to receive scoring data and case context automatically from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring, so that automation of case creation and validation is supported based on scoring rules.

Additional Description:
	•	ECM should ingest metadata including task ID, event ID, rule hits, and scoring breakdown.
	•	Auto-task creation should happen where rules are triggered.
	•	ECM should be able to differentiate between new scoring-based events and previously known ones.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	ECM must store the scoring details for all relevant FCC LA cases.
	•	Task ID, rule ID, and associated mappings should be auto-ingested.
	•	Auto-task creation should occur when a valid scoring trigger is received from FCC LA.

Line Item 9 — STORY 8137879

Story:
As a Reporting Analyst, I want all ECM reports to include contextual monitoring metrics such as backtesting cases and auto-closed cases, so that efficiency and performance can be accurately measured.

Additional Description:
	•	Reports should reflect:
	•	Dispositioned cases
	•	Backtesting outcomes
	•	Auto-closure metrics
	•	Month-on-month efficiency
	•	Rule-level contribution to scoring
	•	Performance of backtesting rules
	•	This data supports impact analysis and effectiveness tracking.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Reports should include backtesting cases.
	•	Reports should include auto-closed cases from contextual monitoring.
