Red Flag: CIB_WIRE_TRXN_AM

Business Requirement:
To monitor the total wire transaction amount initiated by the focal entity. A higher total may indicate large fund movement through electronic channels.

Technical Specifications:
Captures the minimum of wire transaction amount and average transaction value, aggregating from incoming and outgoing wires.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CIB_WIRE_TRXN_AM = 1:min(1, N_WIRE_AVG_TRXN_AM_IP/N_WIRE_AVG_TRXN_AM)

⸻

Red Flag: CIB_CASH_TRXN_AM

Business Requirement:
To identify the extent of cash-based transaction activity. High volumes of cash activity can indicate attempts to avoid traceable channels.

Technical Specifications:
Sum of inbound and outbound cash transactions, normalized over historical average.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CIB_CASH_TRXN_AM = 1:min(1, N_CASH_AVG_TRXN_AM_IP/N_CASH_AVG_TRXN_AM)

⸻

Red Flag: N_CDT_TRXN_CT_EXT

Business Requirement:
Total number of credit transactions between the customer and external counterparties.

Technical Specifications:
Captures credit flows based on maximum transaction count or summed amount, depending on context.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CASE WHEN MAX(a.cdt_ext_count) > 0 THEN (COUNT(a.cdt_cntr_party_amt_ext) + MAX(a.cdt_trxn_count_ext)) ELSE 0 END

⸻

Red Flag: N_SD_CASH_CDT_AMT_IP

Business Requirement:
To measure variation in incoming cash credit amounts over the last 12 months. Helps identify irregular or inconsistent patterns.

Technical Specifications:
Standard deviation of incoming cash transaction amounts aggregated monthly.

Feature Pseudo Logic:

SELECT prmy_cust_intrnl_id,
ROUND(STDDEV(trxn_amt_ip)) AS N_SD_CASH_CDT_AMT_IP  
FROM (Cash_IN_TXN_AM)  
GROUP BY prmy_cust_intrnl_id, month_smy_start_dt

Red Flag: N_SD_CASH_DBT_AMT_IP

Business Requirement:
To measure variation in outgoing cash debit amounts over the last 12 months. Spikes may indicate anomalous withdrawals.

Technical Specifications:
Standard deviation of outgoing cash debit amounts, aggregated at the customer-month level.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
SELECT prmy_cust_intrnl_id,
ROUND(STDDEV(trxn_amt_ip)) AS N_SD_CASH_DBT_AMT_IP  
FROM (Cash_OUT_TXN_AM)  
GROUP BY prmy_cust_intrnl_id, month_smy_start_dt

Red Flag: N_WIRE_TRXN_CT_IP

Business Requirement:
Total number of wire transactions initiated by the focal entity in the past 12 months.

Technical Specifications:
Count of transactions from inbound and outbound WIRE channels.

Feature Pseudo Logic:

SELECT prmy_cust_intrnl_id,
COUNT(wire_trxn_ct) AS N_WIRE_TRXN_CT_IP  
FROM (WIRE_TRXN_IN_CT, WIRE_TRXN_OUT_CT)  
GROUP BY prmy_cust_intrnl_id

Red Flag: N_CASH_TRXN_CT_IP

Business Requirement:
Total number of cash transactions (inbound and outbound) in the past 12 months.

Technical Specifications:
Combined count of incoming and outgoing cash transaction types for the customer.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
SELECT prmy_cust_intrnl_id,
CASE WHEN SUM(CASH_TRXN_IN_CT) > 0 OR SUM(CASH_TRXN_OUT_CT) > 0 
THEN (CASH_TRXN_IN_CT + CASH_TRXN_OUT_CT) ELSE 0 END  
AS N_CASH_TRXN_CT_IP

Red Flag: N_AVG_TIME_CNSCTV_TRXN

Business Requirement:
Measures the average time between consecutive transactions. Lower time gaps can indicate frequent, potentially suspicious activity.

Technical Specifications:
Derived from transaction history to compute average gap between transaction timestamps.

Feature Pseudo Logic:

N_AVG_TIME_CNSCTV_TRXN = 1 - N_SHORTEST_TIME_CNSCTV_TRXN / N_AVG_TIME_CNSCTV_TRXN

Red Flag: N_SD_CASH_TRXN_AM

Business Requirement:
To track variability in the amount of individual cash transactions. High volatility might indicate structured or irregular behavior.

Technical Specifications:
Calculated using standard deviation of cash amounts across transactions.

Feature Pseudo Logic:

SELECT prmy_cust_intrnl_id,
ROUND(STDDEV(cash_trxn_amt_ext)) AS N_SD_CASH_TRXN_AM  
FROM cash_trxn  
GROUP BY prmy_cust_intrnl_id
