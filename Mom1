Hi All,

Following up on the below MoM regarding the ECM enablement for Egypt (EG) and Saudi Arabia (SA) under EPIC 8171428, I would like to highlight a key clarification and share the tentative implementation timeline for your alignment.

‚∏ª

üîç Environment Assumption Clarification

At the time of raising this Epic, it was assumed that the ECM setup ‚Äî including configuration, testing, and validations ‚Äî would be supported via a unified environment structure, i.e., a common or synchronized setup across both Sandbox and Production.

This was essential to enable complete and consistent end-to-end testing using actual case structures, alert logic, and data behavior in line with the existing 25-market implementation.

However, we now understand that the sandbox is currently not provisioned for EG and SA in ECM.
Please note that, due to regulatory and data governance constraints, we cannot use production data in lower environments, which poses significant limitations in:
	‚Ä¢	Alert simulation and case creation
	‚Ä¢	SIT/UAT validation with realistic event data
	‚Ä¢	Final tuning and BAU readiness activities

We kindly request the ECM team to provision and set up the sandbox environment for both Egypt and Saudi Arabia, aligned with the production configuration. This is essential to proceed with the planned testing, tuning, SIT, and UAT activities in a compliant and controlled manner.

‚∏ª

üìÖ Tentative Timeline for Egypt & Saudi Arabia Implementation:
	‚Ä¢	Country Data Migration Completion (EG & SA): Targeted by mid-July 2025
	‚Ä¢	Testing, Tuning, SIT & UAT: Planned to start post migration and complete by end of Q3 2025, in the sandbox using production-aligned data
	‚Ä¢	Go-Live Implementation: Tentatively scheduled for the first half of Q4 2025, subject to successful UAT sign-off

‚∏ª

‚ùìAdditional Clarification / Query:

As we progress toward these timelines, we would also like to check with the ECM team:

Is there a provision to create a placeholder or preliminary configuration for these new countries (EG & SA) within ECM, even before UAT sign-off is complete?
This could help accelerate production readiness later.
Would it be technically feasible to configure the country setup ahead of time, and temporarily disable case generation ‚Äî for example, by feeding in a zero-byte file or suppressing alerts ‚Äî until all dependencies are finalized?

Appreciate your thoughts and guidance on this.
