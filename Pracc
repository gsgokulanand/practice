Title:

FCCLA Cutover for Contextual Monitoring Implementation

⸻

Description:

The FCCLA (Link Analysis) engine will be decommissioned as part of the migration to the new Contextual Monitoring solution within the MANTAS AML platform. This cutover will involve:
	•	Stopping FCCLA delta batch execution and scoring as of xx-xx-xxxx
	•	Ensuring that FCCLA UI displays data only up to the cutover date
	•	Clearing FCCLA processing queues to free up resources for contextual monitoring batches
	•	Performing incremental data synchronization for the period xx-xx-xxxx to xx-xx-xxxx to contextual monitoring via data pipeline
	•	Validating data completeness and batch success prior to go-live on xx-xx-xxxx
	•	Executing rollback plan if critical issues are observed during UAT/go-live

Key Responsibilities for FCCLA Team:
	•	Disable delta batch for FCCLA post cutover date
	•	Validate that no scoring or case generation occurs in FCCLA after cutover
	•	Support rollback execution if required

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	FCCLA delta batch and scoring processes are completely stopped as of the cutover date (xx-xx-xxxx).
	2.	FCCLA UI reflects data only until the cutover date, with no incremental updates afterward.
	3.	FCCLA processing queues are cleared and confirmed free for contextual monitoring batches.
	4.	Data reconciliation confirms that all historical data before cutover remains intact and accessible in FCCLA UI for audit.
	5.	Rollback plan is documented and executable without impacting new data processing.
	6.	Stakeholder confirmation received that FCCLA is decommissioned post contextual monitoring go-live (if successful).
