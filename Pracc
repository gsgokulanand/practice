Purpose & Scope of the Application
•The Securities Services AML (Anti-Money Laundering) application monitors and detects suspicious activities in securities transactions. It aims to:
•• Provide architecture and data flow for the AML Transaction Monitoring process.
•• Explain how risk indicators (RIs) detect potential Financial Crime risks.
•• Use upstream systems data, scoring logic, and data quality checks to generate alerts.
•• Support investigations by Compliance and Risk teams.

Background
•• Increased industry and regulatory focus led to FCC identifying Financial Crime risks in Securities Services.
•• FATF guidance in 2019 recommended a risk-based approach for the securities sector.
•• Securities Services were earlier not under full AML transaction monitoring; a project was initiated to cover gaps.
•• 26 Risk Indicators were developed based on AML typologies such as behavior anomalies, high-risk jurisdictions, and transaction patterns.
Architecture & Data Flow
•• Data is sourced from upstream systems like MFU, SCI, ACT, RDM, SCORe, and MANTAS.
•• Data flows into EDM (Enterprise Data Management) and is processed by:
•   - RI Engine for Risk Indicator generation
•   - DQ (Data Quality) Engine for anomaly checks
•• Processed data is sent to ECM for investigator review.
•• Monthly batch process refreshes risk scenarios and generates alerts.
