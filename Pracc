Hi Jeyabalan,

Thanks for the clarification.

✔️ For the interim approach, we agree to proceed with trimming the problematic record(s) at source and reloading into ECM.

✔️ For the permanent approach, business has concurred that trimming will be the standard, and we will raise a CR/ADO to ECM to formalize this.

Request you to please resume the failure batches (Tradeport and SS) once the fix is confirmed with CR implementation at the end of this cycle.

Thanks & Regards,
Gokul
