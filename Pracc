Performance Review | 2025

Performance and Achievements
	•	Supported end-to-end testing for FSS AML new country rollouts (Saudi & Egypt) by organizing weekly/biweekly calls with country teams, driving concurrence on thresholds, HRG watchlists, and approvals. Ensured completion of DQA, SIT, and UAT ahead of tech go-live by year-end 2025 and tracked IGA completion for Saudi business go-live in Q1 2026.
	•	Managed BTL segmentation, tuning, and BTG batch runs for TH, MY, VN, SG, AE, and HK. Coordinated with SPOT team for sample validation and execution within planned timelines.
	•	Supported AA Investigation data preparation by providing customized event and transaction extracts for BTL team despite automation in place, ensuring timely closure of ad hoc requests.
	•	Led AE Retuning (annual activity) for AE region — coordinated reporting, implemented Control-M regulatory changes to reduce case creation delays, and streamlined retuning efficiency.
	•	Successfully coordinated funding closure for FSS AML rollouts (Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, Egypt) after multiple approvals and follow-ups for both BAU and tech budgets.
	•	Supported Catalyst Migration testing and go-live with technology team, ensuring flawless migration through multiple validation cycles and DRA testing.
	•	Handled critical batch and ECM data failures, performed impact analysis, and proposed long-term fixes for application and ECM layers to prevent recurrence.
	•	Took complete ownership of Contextual Monitoring ADO governance, managing story creation, acceptance criteria, and stakeholder alignment with tech, testing, and business teams.
	•	Created key project documentation — Validation Mechanism and Implementation Approach for Contextual Monitoring.
	•	Led ECM–Quantexa integration by running frequent sync-ups with product owners, BAs, and tech teams to resolve dependencies and fast-track integration.
	•	Provided BAU and environment support (SPOT and AA queries, new environment enablement for ATK and segmentation). Supported HashiCorp Vault onboarding, OneCert migration, and MLR 40 SIT/UAT completion with timely closure.
	•	Regularly presented quarterly BRM/SRM updates, ran PWG calls, and contributed to BOW discussions with technology heads, highlighting progress and resource planning.
