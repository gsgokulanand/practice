	•	UAT validation and sign-off checks
	•	Rollback strategy in case of major outages
	•	Dependencies, risks, and mitigation plans

Action Required:
Please review the document and share:
	•	Any open points or additional details that need to be included

I will incorporate your feedback and finalize the detailed version.
