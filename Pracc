1. Total CCAML Case Population
	•	Total CCAML cases analysed: 2,490
	•	Customer segmentation:
	•	CASA-linked customers: 2,030 cases (81.5%)
	•	Standalone credit card customers: 460 cases (18.5%)

Insight:
The CCAML population is predominantly CASA-linked, with more than 4 out of 5 cases associated with customers holding broader banking relationships.

⸻

2. Correlation with MANTAS AML Events
	•	CCAML cases correlated with MANTAS AML events remain consistently low.
	•	Correlated cases account for approximately 3–5% of total CCAML case volumes, depending on the month.
	•	On an absolute basis, this translates to ~18–25 correlated cases per month, against ~430–530 total CCAML cases per month.

Insight:
The current correlation contributes to a limited reduction in overall case volumes at a portfolio level.

⸻

3. Correlation by Customer Segment
	•	Low correlation rates are observed across both customer segments:
	•	CASA-linked customers: correlation remains in the 3–5% range
	•	Standalone credit card customers: correlation also remains in the 3–5% range

Insight:
Customer type does not materially influence correlation behaviour between CCAML and MANTAS events.

⸻

4. Clarification on Customer-Level Views
	•	Differences observed between earlier and recent customer-level views arise from:
	•	Snapshot versus consolidated aggregation
	•	Representation of the standalone customer indicator
	•	There is no inconsistency in underlying data; the views represent the same population at different aggregation levels.

⸻

5. Key Inferences
	•	The existing correlation between CCAML and MANTAS contributes to a very limited proportion of total CCAML cases.
	•	Approximately 95% of CCAML cases are investigated independently under the current operating model.
	•	Correlation today is primarily informational and does not materially change investigation prioritisation or outcomes.
