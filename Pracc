Hi Yong Yong and An,

As part of the FSS AML rollout for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, we are planning to proceed with the technical go-live implementation by the first week of December 2025.

Due to the very low transaction volume currently available at the source systems, and the absence of IGA setup for Saudi Arabia, we are unable to perform business go-live activities at this stage. Accordingly, the business go-live (ECM scenario activation) is planned for Q1 2026, once transactions start flowing and the Saudi IGA confirmation is received.

These details have already been discussed with the country teams, ECM team, and 1LOD Risk team. Upon receiving your approval, we will proceed to obtain AML RFO endorsement and move forward with the technical go-live implementation as planned.

Kindly provide your confirmation to proceed, and please refer to the attached email communications for background reference.

Thanks & Regards,
Gokul Anand
