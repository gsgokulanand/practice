Please find the key points from the Securities Services (source) team discussion for your confirmation:
	1.	Existing settlement entries (delivery vs. receipt) will continue in the current secure system.
	2.	The new ESS platform will generate billing and receivable entries going forward.
	3.	Each invoice will post two entries â€“ debit to sundry receivables and credit to the respective client/department account.
	4.	Need confirmation if these ESS entries will replace or co-exist with current UT entries, and whether any additional monitoring or reconciliation controls are required during transition.
	5.	Please also confirm that there is no AML risk or control impact arising from this change.
