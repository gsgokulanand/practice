As part of the FSS AML rollout for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, we have completed all key implementation activities including data assessment, configuration, end-to-end testing, and ECM integration readiness.

However, due to very limited transactions at the source systems (Egypt – 0 transactions, Saudi Arabia – 7 transactions), we are currently unable to generate AML events and cases. This has impacted our ability to execute and close UAT and UVT activities at the ECM side.

To ensure compliance with the regulatory commitments for both countries within this year, we are proposing to:
	•	Proceed with the technical go-live as planned in November, incorporating the final approved thresholds and watchlist configurations.
	•	Defer the business go-live (ECM scenario activation) until transactions start flowing from the source systems, expected early next year.

We request your approval or clarification to proceed with this approach so we can plan the necessary activities accordingly.
