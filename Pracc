✅ Validation Mechanism Document – Revised

1. Objective

Ensure the successful validation of the integrated Mantas AML + FCCLA Contextual Monitoring solution by verifying:
	•	Accurate event scoring and case creation using contextual monitoring.
	•	Seamless data flow from Mantas → FCCLA Engine → ECM → Quantexa UI.
	•	Elimination/reduction of false positives compared to previous approach.
	•	Compliance with internal AML standards and regulatory requirements.

⸻

2. Scope
	•	Validate data flow across systems.
	•	Verify event scoring accuracy and consistency.
	•	Validate case creation and prioritization logic.
	•	Measure impact on false positives using backtesting.
	•	Decommission legacy FCCLA engine without duplicate processing.
	•	Ensure DQ and reporting accuracy post go-live.

⸻

3. Key Validation Areas

3.1 Data Flow Validation
	•	File Transfer: Confirm completeness and integrity of files transferred between Mantas and FCCLA.
	•	Event ID Mapping: Ensure one-to-one mapping between Mantas Event ID, FCCLA Scored Event, and ECM Case ID.

3.2 Event Scoring Validation
	•	Validate scoring against contextual attributes (customer, network, transaction behavior).
	•	Verify threshold-based outcomes: Snoozed, Escalated, Discounted, or Promoted.
	•	Validate consolidated score computation for multiple events tied to one case.

3.3 Case Creation & Promotion
	•	Ensure ECM case creation occurs only post FCCLA scoring.
	•	Validate case prioritization logic based on aggregated contextual score.
	•	Confirm updates to case state (new/un-snoozed/hibernated/escalated).

3.4 Data Quality (DQ) & Exception Handling
	•	Stage 1 DQ: ECM → FCCLA (clean and valid records only).
	•	Stage 2 DQ: Post-scoring reconciliation for dropped/failed records.
	•	Maintain exception logs for remediation.

3.5 UI & Reporting
	•	ECM UI should display event score and rule description for every event.
	•	Validate OBIEE reporting for:
	•	Case dispositions.
	•	Backtesting metrics.
	•	Efficiency improvements.
	•	Rule performance tracking.

3.6 Decommissioning of Old FCCLA
	•	Ensure legacy FCCLA engine is disabled at go-live.
	•	Validate no duplicate scoring or case creation from old system.

3.7 False Positive Verification (Backtesting)

To measure the impact of contextual monitoring on reducing false positives:
	•	Approach:
	1.	Select a sample batch of transactions/events from production processed without contextual monitoring.
	2.	Run the same batch through FCCLA contextual monitoring engine.
	3.	Compare results for:
	•	Number of alerts generated (previous vs. new approach).
	•	Number of RFIs raised (previous vs. new).
	•	Cases closed as “Risk Irrelevant” (previous vs. new).
	4.	Document reduction percentage in false positives.
	•	Validation Metrics:
	•	False Positive Reduction % =
\frac{\text{False Positives (Old)}}{\text{False Positives (New)}} \times 100
	•	Target: Minimum X% reduction as per business acceptance criteria (define X during UAT).
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Reduction in non-actionable cases compared to previous method.
	•	Backtesting evidence stored for audit and model validation.


5. Test Scenarios
	•	Scenario 1: High-risk transaction → Case escalated with high score.
	•	Scenario 2: Low-risk transaction → Snoozed or discounted.
	•	Scenario 3: Invalid event → Dropped at DQ stage.
	•	Scenario 4: Backtesting → Compare previous batch results vs. contextual monitoring results.

⸻

6. Sign-Off Criteria
	•	≥99% data integrity across all systems.
	•	100% case creation accuracy for valid events.
	•	Zero duplicate scoring from legacy FCCLA.
	•	Documented false positive reduction (backtesting completed with evidence).
	•	Compliance alignment confirmed with AML regulatory standards.
