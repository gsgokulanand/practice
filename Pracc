Team,

We propose the following tactical approach for handling CC AML, Rules2/Model, and Contextual Monitoring events until the decoupling work is taken up:
	1.	Continue using the existing ingestion flow for all event types.
	2.	Apply a common scoring approach across CC AML, Rules2/Model, and Contextual Monitoring.
	3.	Maintain entity-based case creation and correlation:
	•	Promoted CC AML / Rules2 / Model events crossing thresholds will link to an existing case or create a new one.
	•	Contextual Monitoring events breaching thresholds will create and correlate to the same entity case.

This ensures consistent detection and case handling during the transition.

The decoupling changes can be implemented after the successful Contextual Monitoring go-live phase.
