Cutover Plan for FCCLA to Contextual Monitoring Implementation

Solution: MANTAS AML
Implementation Date: September 10, 2025
Prepared For: Compliance Technology & AML Operations

⸻

1. Objective

To ensure a seamless transition from FCCLA (Link Analysis) to the new Contextual Monitoring framework, while maintaining data integrity, system stability, and compliance obligations. The plan includes rollback measures in case of critical failures during or after go-live.

3. Cutover Approach

3.1 FCCLA Decommissioning Steps
	1.	Execute last FCCLA batch on Aug 31 and perform final incremental load.
	2.	Archive FCCLA OBIEE reports for compliance.
	3.	Release FCCLA processing queue on Sept 1 for contextual monitoring.

⸻

3.2 Contextual Monitoring Deployment
	1.	Deploy contextual monitoring rules and configuration on Sept 10.
	2.	Validate contextual monitoring data ingestion and batch execution for completeness.

⸻

3.3 Data Catch-Up (Sept 1–9)
	•	Use data pipeline batches to sync all transactions for this period into contextual monitoring DB.
	•	Validate for data completeness and duplicate prevention.
	•	Ensure contextual monitoring has full coverage before go-live.

⸻

4. Validation & UAT on Go-Live (Sept 10)
	•	Stakeholders and compliance users will perform UAT validation on contextual monitoring batch results.
	•	Validation checks will include:
	•	Alert generation accuracy
	•	OBIEE reporting accuracy
	•	Batch performance and processing time
	•	Sign-off will be granted only after successful validation.

⸻

5. Rollback Strategy
	•	If validation is successful:
	•	Proceed with permanent FCCLA decommissioning.
	•	If major outages or data inconsistencies occur in contextual monitoring:
	•	Execute rollback to FCCLA immediately without impacting subsequent scheduled batches.
	•	Rollback steps include:
	1.	Re-enable FCCLA queue and restore configuration.
	2.	Reload transactions post-cutover date (Sept 10) into FCCLA.
	3.	Suspend contextual monitoring batches until issue resolution.
	•	Rollback must be pre-approved by Compliance and Technology leads.

⸻

6. Dependencies & Assumptions
	•	Infrastructure readiness for contextual monitoring and Elasticsearch.
	•	No dual processing – FCCLA fully stops before contextual monitoring starts.
	•	Data reconciliation between FCCLA and contextual monitoring completed before sign-off.
	•	Rollback plan tested and documented.
8. Post-Cutover Activities
	•	Perform backtesting of contextual monitoring alerts against historical FCCLA alerts.
	•	Enhanced monitoring for the first two weeks.
	•	Prepare sign-off report and obtain final approvals.
