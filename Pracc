Hi Anand, Gokul,

As discussed, please find below the current status of correlation between CCAML and MANTAS AML events for the Hong Kong portfolio, along with supporting data points.

Current Observation – CCAML Standalone vs Correlated Cases

Based on the recent monthly data:
	•	The majority of CCAML cases are generated as standalone cases, without correlation to MANTAS events.
	•	Only a very small percentage of CCAML cases are currently correlated with MANTAS AML events.

Case Volume Summary (Illustrative):
	•	For the periods Aug’25 to Dec’25, CCAML standalone cases range between 430–530 cases per month.
	•	Out of these, the number of cases correlated with MANTAS events is minimal, for example:
	•	Aug’25: 19 correlated cases
	•	Sep’25: 18 correlated cases
	•	This represents less than 5% of total CCAML case volumes.

Customer-Level View:
	•	CCAML cases are largely split across:
	•	Standalone customer = No
	•	Standalone customer = Yes
	•	However, correlation with MANTAS remains consistently low across both categories.

Key Inference:
	•	The existing correlation between CCAML and MANTAS contributes to a very limited reduction in case volume.
	•	Most CCAML risks are investigated independently even today.
	•	This data supports the view that decoupling CCAML and MANTAS processing will not materially impact investigative coverage, while enabling clearer ownership, simpler processing, and improved optimization at a product level.
