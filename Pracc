Performance and Achievements
	•	Supported FSS AML new country rollouts (Saudi & Egypt) by coordinating weekly/biweekly calls with country teams to finalize thresholds, HRG watchlists, and approval milestones. Ensured timely completion of DQA, SIT, and UAT ahead of tech go-live (targeted for end-2025) and tracked Saudi IGA readiness for Q1 2026 business go-live.
	•	Took ownership of Contextual Monitoring activities — managing ADO governance, ensuring clear story descriptions and acceptance criteria, and driving resolution across BA, Product, and Tech teams. Also prepared the Validation Mechanism and Implementation Approach documents currently under review. Received appreciation from Cheytan (Program Manager) for on-time delivery of targeted Q4 items.
	•	Engaged with Cayden (Product Owner) to share FSS AML topologies and scenario design to help define Blockchain Monitoring architecture, earning formal appreciation for valuable contribution.
	•	Contributed to the Catalyst (HDP to CDP) migration, focusing on ORA optimization of the zero-byte file mechanism that caused batch outages. Successfully fixed the issue with the tech team and implemented key improvements including entity name normalization, EOM archival, and ACT logic — driven from review to SIT/UAT completion.
	•	Worked closely with the technology team on BAU fixes and enhancements, ensuring proper prioritization and closure across multiple sprints. Supported SPOT and AA teams for query resolution and environment enablement. Completed HashiCorp Vault onboarding, OneCert migration, and MLR-40 SIT/UAT closure with timely approvals.
	•	Supported AE Retuning (Annual Cycle) — collaborated with SPOT and BTL teams to execute retuning activities and implemented Control-M regulatory updates to reduce turnaround between event and case creation.
	•	Explored the use of AI tools like Databricks and AGETIC AI for potential integration of intelligent rule detection and model tuning.
	•	Received multiple stakeholder appreciations for consistent ownership, technical depth, and collaborative approach across projects.
