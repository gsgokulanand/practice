Story Description – Data Loading into CXTM Layer

Once source system data extraction is complete, load the data into the CXTM layer write schema tables.
This involves mapping extracted fields to target table structures, applying required transformations, and validating completeness before handing over for downstream consumption.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria – Data Loading to CXTM Layer
	1.	Target write schema tables created/updated as per approved data model.
	2.	Field mapping from source to target completed and documented.
	3.	Data loaded successfully with all mandatory fields populated.
	4.	Transformations applied as per business rules.
	5.	Row counts and control totals match between source extraction and CXTM load.
	6.	No data truncation, format mismatch, or type errors.
	7.	Load logs captured, stored, and reviewed for errors.
	8.	Sign-off obtained from Data/QA teams after validation.
