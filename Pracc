•	T0 → The cutover/go-live date (the exact day when you switch from old system to new).
	•	T–XX → Tasks that must be completed before go-live (XX = number of days before).
	•	Example: T–7 = 7 days before cutover.
	•	Example: T–1 = the day before cutover.
	•	T+XX → Tasks that must be completed after go-live (XX = number of days after).
	•	Example: T+1 = the day after cutover.
	•	Example: T+30 = 30 days after go-live (common for post-implementation validation or hypercare closure).
