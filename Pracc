Hi Peter,

During today’s ECM batch load testing, we encountered an issue while pushing data from Spark/Hive to Oracle. The error is caused by certain records in the V_PROD_TYPE column exceeding the Oracle target column definition (VARCHAR2(20 CHAR)), which results in insert failures.

To ensure the batch run completes successfully, we propose a tactical workaround:
	•	Trim the V_PROD_TYPE field to 20 characters at the source itself during Spark processing.
	•	This will align the data with the Oracle schema and allow the load to proceed without further errors.

Requesting your approval to implement this trimming approach for the ECM batch run. Please confirm if we can proceed.
