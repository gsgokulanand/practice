Subject: Approval Required – FSS AML Rollout Plan and Technical Go-Live for Egypt

Dear Egypt FCC Team,

As part of the FSS AML rollout for Egypt, we have successfully completed all key implementation activities including data assessment, configuration, end-to-end testing, and ECM integration readiness.

However, due to no transactions available at the source system (0 transactions so far), we are unable to generate AML events and cases. As a result, we face a challenge in executing and closing UAT and UVT activities at the ECM side.

In line with the recommendation from the ECM team (attached for reference), we propose the following approach:
	•	Proceed with the technical go-live in the system as planned, incorporating the final approved thresholds and watchlist configurations.
	•	Defer ECM scenario activation until the source systems start generating transactions, expected early next year.

This approach will help us meet regulatory compliance timelines for this year while ensuring that the system is fully ready for activation once live data becomes available.

I will also be seeking RFO and Accountable Executive approvals for the November technical go-live. Hence, your confirmation and approval to proceed with this approach will be highly appreciated.

Your prompt response will help us finalize the rollout plan and schedule the related activities accordingly.

Warm regards,
Gokul Anand

Subject: Approval Required – FSS AML Rollout Plan and Technical Go-Live for Saudi Arabia

Dear Saudi FCC Team,

As part of the FSS AML rollout for Saudi Arabia, we have successfully completed all key implementation activities including data assessment, configuration, end-to-end testing, and ECM integration readiness.

However, due to very limited transaction availability at the source (only 7 transactions identified so far), we are unable to generate AML events and cases. Consequently, we face a challenge in completing and closing UAT and UVT activities at the ECM end.

Based on the recommendation from the ECM team (attached for reference), we propose the following approach:
	•	Proceed with the technical go-live in the system as planned, including the final approved thresholds and watchlist configurations.
	•	Defer ECM scenario activation until source transactions become available, expected next year.

This approach ensures that we meet regulatory requirements within the current year and are prepared for full ECM activation once the data feed stabilizes.

I will also be seeking RFO and Accountable Executive approvals for the November technical go-live. Therefore, your approval and confirmation to proceed with this implementation approach will be greatly appreciated.

Your prompt response will help us finalize the rollout plan and plan subsequent actions accordingly.

Subject: FSS AML – Technical Go-Live Plan for Egypt and Saudi Arabia

Dear [Name],

This is to inform you that as part of the FSS AML rollout for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, we have completed all key implementation activities including data assessment, configuration, and end-to-end testing.

However, as the client migration is yet to take place at the source systems, only a very limited number of transactions are currently available (almost nil for Egypt and minimal for Saudi Arabia). This has resulted in no event or case creation, and hence we are unable to perform UAT and UVT activities at this stage.

Since this is a regulatory requirement from both countries and funding has been approved for completion within this year, we plan to proceed with the technical go-live in November.

Request you to kindly complete the necessary actions in the CRA document and related governance requirements to support the technical go-live.
