Story Title:

TM_Contextual Monitoring: Enablement for Receiving Scored Events from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring into MANTAS (Oracle Source)

⸻

Description

Story:
As a MANTAS (Oracle) source system owner, I want to enable data reception and interface readiness to receive enriched and scored events from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring so that these can be stored within MANTAS for downstream ECM case management as part of BAU operations.

⸻

Additional Description:
	1.	Oracle MANTAS source must enable the interface endpoint (JDBC/File/SFTP/API) to receive enriched event data from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring.
	2.	The received dataset will include event scores, applied rule IDs, and contextual narratives for each Event_ID.
	3.	The data should be inserted or updated in existing MANTAS tables with referential integrity maintained (Event_ID, Entity_ID, Country, Score_Rule_ID, Score_Description).
	4.	The interface must perform basic reconciliation and log transfer confirmation for each batch received.
	5.	SLA, schema validation, and failure logging to be aligned with existing MANTAS–ECM integration standards.

No. of minimum Batches Expected:
2 (1 Processing and 1 Bug fixing if any per Market)

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	MANTAS (Oracle source) successfully receives and stores enriched events from FCC LA Contextual Monitoring.
	•	Interface validation confirms successful record updates with correct field mappings.
	•	Any failed transfers or schema mismatches are logged for reprocessing.
