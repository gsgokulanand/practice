Hi Vimala,

During the data assessment exercise for Taiwan, we observed that the total settled secure trade count for a month is 74,204, whereas for Hong Kong the count is 335,322. This means Taiwanâ€™s secure trade count is approximately 78% lower than Hong Kong.

Given this difference, we believe that 1 FTE will be sufficient for case investigation in Taiwan.

For reference, please find attached the DQ assessment sheet along with the query results used for the analysis.

Thanks,
Gokul
