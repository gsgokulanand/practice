Hi Chui Ling,

Just wanted to take a moment to appreciate the way you contributed during today’s DQ meeting with the KR team. Your clarity on the issues, especially around the control aspects, really helped keep the discussion structured and focused.

I also want to acknowledge the consistent ownership you’ve been showing in BAU — the way you handle DQ issues end-to-end and provide early forecasting makes a big difference to the overall stability of our workstream. Your attention to detail, particularly around controls, continues to raise the quality bar for the team.

In addition to this, your support on the FSS AML DQ items and the KT overview you shared with the team have been extremely helpful. It has enabled smoother handovers and improved understanding across teams.

Thanks again for the proactive effort and reliability you bring every day. It’s truly appreciated.
