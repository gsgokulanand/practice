Introduction: What is Securities Services?

Securities Services is a part of banking that supports clients in holding, settling, and safeguarding financial instruments such as shares, bonds, and other securities.
It involves activities like:
	•	Custody – Safekeeping securities on behalf of clients
	•	Settlement – Ensuring transactions between buyer and seller are completed smoothly
	•	Corporate Actions – Handling dividends, interest payments, or stock splits
	•	Asset Servicing – Providing data, valuations, and transaction reporting

Why AML Matters Here
Even though securities services are not direct “cash” transactions like retail banking, they can be misused to launder money or hide illicit activity.
For example:
	•	Moving securities between accounts can disguise ownership changes
	•	Off-market transactions can transfer value without triggering cash transaction monitoring
	•	Large trades can be used to layer or integrate illicit funds

How AML Risks Fit in Securities Services

The Securities Services AML application identifies patterns and anomalies in securities transactions that may indicate financial crime.
It does this using 26 Risk Indicators (RIs), each linked to AML typologies such as:
	•	Anomalies in Behavior
	•	Change in Behavior
	•	High-Risk Jurisdictions

Example Scenarios from the RI List
	1.	RI 1001 – Transactions in Inactive Accounts
	•	Risk: A dormant securities account suddenly starts executing trades, possibly to move illicit assets.
	•	Example: An account with no activity for 18 months starts selling high-value bonds.
	2.	RI 1006 – Short Period Between Account Opening and Closing
	•	Risk: Shell accounts may be opened just to perform a few suspicious transactions and then closed.
	•	Example: A new securities account buys and quickly sells bearer bonds, then closes within 30 days.
	3.	RI 1011 – Trend to High-Risk Jurisdictions
	•	Risk: Transactions involving countries known for weak AML controls.
	•	Example: A client’s trades suddenly involve securities issued in a sanctioned jurisdiction.
	4.	RI 1017 – Unusual/Suspicious Volume with Off-Market Transaction
	•	Risk: Off-market trades can bypass normal market oversight.
	•	Example: An unusually large block of shares is transferred privately without going through the stock exchange.
	5.	RI 1025 – Unusual Volume of Securities + Outward Payment
	•	Risk: Securities are sold and proceeds are sent quickly to unrelated third parties.
	•	Example: Client sells bonds worth $5M, then wires the amount to an offshore account within 24 hours.

If you like, I can add this introduction and example scenarios as the opening two slides in your existing PPT so the audience gets a clear context before diving into architecture and data flows. This way, your presentation will tell the “story” from what & why to how.
