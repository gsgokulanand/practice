Just to update, the ECM timelines for the Contextual Monitoring development are still under finalization, as we’ve not yet received the confirmed dates from the team.

I’ve sent them an email with all necessary details and a prioritization request to commence ECM development by Q4 2025, with overall Quantexa development expected to complete by mid-Feb 2026.

We’ve also spoken with Alwin, who has recently started coordinating this activity. I’ll keep you posted once the final dates are confirmed.
