Hi Team,

Sharing below a consolidated overview of the current handling of CCAML and MANTAS AML events, the proposed operating model, and supporting portfolio-level insights based on recent data across all in-scope markets.

---

## Background – Current Operating Model

- CCAML events are generated based on credit card transaction monitoring scenarios.
- MANTAS AML events are generated independently based on broader customer and transactional AML monitoring.
- Currently:
  - CCAML and MANTAS events may be correlated at the Enterprise Case Management (ECM) layer.
  - Correlated events are assessed together through a shared optimization layer prior to case promotion.
- In practice, the majority of CCAML cases are already investigated independently, with limited dependency on correlation with MANTAS events.

---

## Current Portfolio Observations (Overall View)

Based on consolidated data across all markets for the last five months:

- Approximately 6% of total CCAML cases relate to standalone credit card customers, while the remaining ~94% involve customers with broader banking relationships.
- Around 9% of CCAML cases are correlated with MANTAS AML events.
- Conversely, approximately 91% of CCAML cases remain uncorrelated with MANTAS AML events and are investigated independently under the current operating model.
- Risk-relevant outcomes are observed across both:
  - CCAML cases correlated with MANTAS AML events, and
  - Standalone (non-correlated) CCAML cases.

## Proposed Operating Model

To improve clarity, efficiency, and risk relevance, the following operating model is proposed:

### CCAML Processing
- All CCAML events will be processed independently.
- Events will flow through a rule-based optimization framework.
- Based on optimization outcomes:
  - Events will be promoted to cases, or
  - Retained at the pre-case (precise) layer where appropriate.

### MANTAS AML Processing
- MANTAS AML events will be processed independently through contextual monitoring.
- Events will be scored using Quantexa.
- Based on the Quantexa score:
  - Events will be promoted to cases, or
  - Auto-closed where the assessed risk is low.

- No forced correlation between CCAML and MANTAS AML events will occur prior to case creation.

---

## Rationale for the Change

- Portfolio data indicates that existing correlation provides limited incremental benefit, given that:
  - The vast majority of CCAML cases (~91%) are already investigated independently.
- Decoupling enables:
  - Clear ownership of CCAML and MANTAS risks
  - Fit-for-purpose optimization aligned to product-specific risk types
  - Reduction of noise and unnecessary case promotion
- Contextual scoring via Quantexa enhances risk relevance for MANTAS events, while rule-based optimization ensures consistent and controlled handling of CCAML events.

## Conclusion

The proposed model maintains full risk coverage while improving operational clarity and efficiency. CCAML and MANTAS AML risks continue to be monitored rigorously, but through independent, purpose-built mechanisms, ensuring that only risk-relevant events are promoted for investigation.

Please let us know if any additional clarification or supporting data would be helpful. We are happy to walk through the approach and observations in more detail if required.

Portfolio-Level Final Insight (to place below the table)

Across markets, CCAML volumes are concentrated in a few countries, standalone credit card exposure remains limited, and correlation with MANTAS AML events is generally low. Higher correlation percentages in certain low-volume markets are driven by scale rather than increased risk relevance. Overall, the majority of CCAML cases continue to be investigated independently, with risk-relevant outcomes observed across both correlated and non-correlated cases.
