Validation Plan for FCC LA Contextual Monitoring

⸻

1. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive validation approach for the FCC LA Contextual Monitoring initiative. The objective is to ensure that the implemented solution meets all functional, non-functional, and regulatory requirements while effectively improving alert quality. A particular focus is given to reducing false positives without introducing significant false negatives, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and compliance adherence.

The validation exercise will encompass rule verification, data integrity checks, end-to-end functional validation, and a structured backtesting approach. This ensures that the contextual monitoring logic performs as intended under real-world conditions.

2. Scope

The validation scope covers the following components:
	•	Configuration and execution of contextual monitoring rules.
	•	Data ingestion and enrichment logic, including mapping of contextual attributes.
	•	Alert generation and prioritization using contextual logic.
	•	Integration with downstream systems such as OBIEE, Case Management UI, and other reporting platforms.
	•	Comparative backtesting against a control batch processed without contextual monitoring logic.
	•	Verification of compliance-related requirements and usability for compliance teams.

⸻

3. Validation Objectives

The primary objectives of this validation plan are:
	1.	Confirm that all contextual rules are correctly implemented and function as per design.
	2.	Validate system behavior during batch processing and ensure expected performance benchmarks are met.
	3.	Evaluate the impact of contextual monitoring on alert volumes and accuracy.
	4.	Validate false positive reduction while ensuring no critical true positives are omitted.
	5.	Confirm smooth data flow and seamless integration between source, processing, and reporting layers.
	6.	Validate the overall usability and compliance readiness of the solution.

4. Validation Strategy

The validation approach has been designed to cover multiple dimensions of testing:
	•	Unit Testing: Verification of individual rules, thresholds, and configurations in isolation.
	•	Integration Testing: Testing of interactions between contextual monitoring engine, ingestion pipelines, and alert generation modules.
	•	System Testing: End-to-end validation of the entire contextual monitoring process, including performance and security checks.
	•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Real-world scenario validation by compliance analysts and key stakeholders.
	•	Backtesting: Comparative evaluation by reprocessing the same batch of data with and without contextual monitoring to measure effectiveness and identify potential gaps.

Each phase is documented with detailed test cases, execution evidence, and result tracking.

5. Validation Phases and Activities

5.1 Unit Testing

Objective: To ensure that each individual component of the contextual monitoring solution works as designed when tested in isolation.
Activities include:
	•	Development of unit test cases for all contextual monitoring rules.
	•	Validation of rule thresholds, parameter configuration, and triggering logic.
	•	Execution of tests with controlled datasets and documentation of results.
	•	Resolution of any defects identified during the execution phase.

⸻

5.2 Integration Testing

Objective: To validate that all integrated components of the system interact correctly and that data flows seamlessly between them.
Key areas of focus:
	•	Verification of data ingestion from source systems into the contextual monitoring engine.
	•	Validation of contextual attribute enrichment and mapping accuracy.
	•	Testing of alert transmission and reporting on OBIEE and UI.
	•	Logging of issues and resolution before moving to system testing.

5.3 System Testing

Objective: To confirm that the system meets both functional and non-functional requirements under production-like conditions.
Activities include:
	•	Running full-scale batch processes with contextual monitoring enabled.
	•	Validating:
	•	Correct application of contextual rules across transaction data.
	•	Accuracy and completeness of alert generation.
	•	Performance validation: Ensuring batch processing completes within defined SLAs under peak load conditions.
	•	Security checks: Ensuring that all data handling complies with data integrity and confidentiality standards.
	•	Backtesting activity:
	•	Running the same historical batch data in two modes:
	1.	Contextual Monitoring Enabled
	2.	Control Mode (No Contextual Monitoring)
	•	Comparing results to measure:
	•	Reduction in false positives
	•	Any introduction of false negatives
	•	Overall effectiveness of contextual monitoring logic

⸻

5.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Objective: To validate the solution from a business and operational perspective, ensuring it meets compliance expectations.
Approach:
	•	Preparation of UAT scenarios based on real-world cases.
	•	Execution of UAT sessions with compliance teams and investigators.
	•	Collection of feedback on alert quality, usability of dashboards, and overall system behavior.
	•	Implementation of necessary changes based on feedback prior to production deployment.

6. Backtesting Methodology

Backtesting is a critical component of this validation strategy to establish confidence in the solution’s effectiveness.

Steps involved:
	1.	Identify historical transaction data representative of typical production scenarios.
	2.	Execute batch processing in two configurations:
	•	With Contextual Monitoring Logic
	•	Without Contextual Monitoring Logic (Baseline)
	3.	Compare the two outputs and evaluate:
	•	Reduction in false positives (target improvement as per business requirement).
	•	Any missed alerts that qualify as true positives (false negatives).
	•	Business justification for observed differences.
	4.	Document findings and obtain sign-off from compliance teams.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	False positives reduced by at least the agreed percentage benchmark.
	•	No critical true positives missed.
	•	Evidence of improved efficiency without compromising compliance.

7. Validation Criteria
	•	Accuracy: Alerts generated must align with detection logic and risk thresholds with minimal false positives and negatives.
	•	Performance: Batch processing must meet SLA benchmarks under peak conditions.
	•	Security: Data confidentiality and integrity maintained throughout processing.
	•	Usability: System should support efficient alert triage by compliance teams, providing clear contextual details.
	•	Backtesting Results: Documented evidence of improvement in alert quality and effectiveness.

8. Data Validation
	•	Validate accuracy and completeness of contextual attributes during ingestion.
	•	Ensure proper mapping and enrichment within the contextual monitoring engine.
	•	Perform data quality checks including cleansing, transformation, and reconciliation with source data.
	•	Validate final alert output against input transactions for consistency.

9. Deliverables
	•	Validation Plan and Test Strategy Document.
	•	Unit, Integration, and System Testing Results.
	•	Backtesting Report with detailed metrics and analysis.
	•	UAT Summary and Sign-off.
	•	Final Validation Closure Report for compliance approval.
