Subject: FSS AML – Data Purge Preparation for 25 Countries

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

Please find below the approach for preparing the data purge activity in FSS AML for the following 25 countries:

ps, th, ng, lk, hk, id, cn, bd, ae, bh, za, zm, ug, kz, pk, qa, sg, my, om, ke, ci, kw, vn, mu

We will begin with SG as the first country for purge activity. Kindly refer to the attached list of transactional data that needs to be purged (mocked into the given SIT schema).

⸻

Steps:
	1.	Extract the oldest transaction date from the three relevant tables.
	2.	Check if MLE 40’s applicable_flag is ‘Y’:
	•	If ‘Y’ and the retention period has elapsed, mark the record as eligible for purging and proceed.
	•	If not eligible (i.e., flag not ‘Y’ or retention not met), skip the purge process.
	3.	Logging:
	•	Whether purged or skipped, log the action in the specified log file format, including input file details.


eligible scenario:
SGOPAML10500425170323 is deleted from this table (Eligible for purging)

non eligijle scenario :
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not found in the country tables (Not eligible)

Please verify the logging format with the program team for consistency.

Let me know if you need any clarification or support for the SG mock data validation.
