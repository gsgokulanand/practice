Hi Team,

As a follow-up to our earlier MoM on ECM enablement for Egypt (EG) and Saudi Arabia (SA) under EPIC 8171428, wanted to share a quick clarification and the expected timelines.

‚∏ª

üîç Environment Assumption

While raising the Epic, the assumption was that ECM setup (config, testing, validations) would be unified across sandbox and production ‚Äî similar to the existing 25-market rollout.

However, we now understand that sandbox isn‚Äôt provisioned for EG/SA yet, and lower environments are being considered for testing.
Due to data policy restrictions, we are unable to test with prod data in lower regions, which blocks:
	‚Ä¢	End-to-end alert simulation and validation
	‚Ä¢	SIT/UAT with realistic flows
	‚Ä¢	Final tuning and BAU readiness

Hence, request ECM team to provision the sandbox setup for EG and SA, aligned to prod config, so that we can proceed with testing and sign-off smoothly.

‚∏ª

üìÖ Tentative Timeline (EG & SA):
	‚Ä¢	Data migration completion: Mid-July 2025
	‚Ä¢	Testing, tuning, SIT & UAT: Q3 2025 (in sandbox with prod-aligned data)
	‚Ä¢	Go-live implementation: 1st half of Q4 2025 (post UAT sign-off)

‚∏ª

‚ùìAdditional Ask

Is it possible for ECM team to pre-configure placeholders for EG and SA now itself, even if UAT is pending?
This will help reduce lead time for go-live. If feasible, can it be done by feeding zero-byte files or disabling case creation temporarily until UAT is complete?

Appreciate your support to keep this rollout on track.
