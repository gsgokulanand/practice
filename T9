GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - CIB_WIRE_TRXN_AM

Business Requirement:
To monitor the total amount of wire transactions sent or received by the focal entity within the lookback window, as higher values could indicate unusual or suspicious activity.

Technical Specifications:
This metric calculates the average transaction amount (mean) for inbound and outbound wire transactions for a customer. It evaluates patterns across both inward and outward flows over the lookback period.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CIB_WIRE_TRXN_AM = t.min(id1, N_WIRE_AVG_TRXN_AM_IP, N_WIRE_AVG_TRXN_AM)

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - CIB_CASH_TRXN_AM

Business Requirement:
To monitor total cash transaction activity (credit and debit) performed by the focal entity. Higher volume may indicate unusual behavior that needs review.

Technical Specifications:
Combines inbound and outbound cash transaction amounts to compute an average activity pattern for the focal customer within the lookback.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CIB_CASH_TRXN_AM = t.min(id1, N_CASH_AVG_TRXN_AM_IP, N_CASH_AVG_TRXN_AM)

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - N_CDT_TRXN_CT_EXT

Business Requirement:
To assess the number of credit transactions from the customer to external parties, which could signal high interaction with third parties.

Technical Specifications:
The count is computed from the number of credit counterparties and their associated transaction values. If counterpart count is > 0, the values are aggregated.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
N_CDT_TRXN_CT_EXT = CASE WHEN MAX(a.cdt_ext_count) > 0 THEN
(COUNT(a.cdt_cntr_party_amt_ext) + MAX(a.cdt_trxn_count_ext))
ELSE 0 END

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - N_SD_CASH_CDT_AMT_IP

Business Requirement:
To detect the volatility of cash credit behavior by measuring the standard deviation of cash credit amounts across the last 12 months.

Technical Specifications:
Standard deviation (RSDDEV) is calculated for cash credit transaction amounts by month over a 12-month period.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
SELECT prmy_cust_int_id,
ROUND(STDDEV(trxn_in_amt), 2) AS N_SD_CASH_CDT_AMT_IP
FROM t_scen_hist_smmry_start_dt
WHERE trxn_in_amt > 0
GROUP BY prmy_cust_int_id

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - N_SD_CASH_DBT_AMT_IP

Business Requirement:
To detect the volatility of cash debit behavior by measuring the standard deviation of cash debit amounts across the last 12 months.

Technical Specifications:
Similar to the cash credit logic, this computes standard deviation of monthly outbound cash flows from the customer.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
SELECT prmy_cust_int_id,
ROUND(STDDEV(trxn_out_amt), 2) AS N_SD_CASH_DBT_AMT_IP
FROM t_scen_hist_smmry_start_dt
WHERE trxn_out_amt > 0
GROUP BY prmy_cust_int_id

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - N_WIRE_TRXN_CT_IP

Business Requirement:
To identify the number of wire transactions made by the customer over the past 12 months. A high frequency could indicate risk.

Technical Specifications:
Counts total number of transactions from wire-in and wire-out transaction types for each customer on a monthly basis.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
SELECT prmy_cust_int_id,
FLOOR(AVG(trxn_in_ct)) AS N_WIRE_TRXN_CT_IP
FROM t_scen_hist_smmry_start_dt
WHERE trxn_in_ct > 0
GROUP BY prmy_cust_int_id

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - _CASH_AMT_RATIO

Business Requirement:
To flag situations where a customer prefers cash over other formal instruments—suggesting attempts to avoid recordkeeping or reduce visibility to authorities.

Technical Specifications:
Calculates the ratio of total cash transactions to the total of all transactions by summing cash transactions and comparing with full activity.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CASH_AMT_RATIO = (N_CASH_TRXN_AM / (N_CASH_TRXN_AM + N_TOT_TRXN_AM))

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - CDT_DBT_BAL_TRXN_SPIKE

Business Requirement:
To detect sudden spikes in the balance of credit and debit transactions which may signify layering or structuring behavior.

Technical Specifications:
Evaluates spikes by computing a z-score or normalized spike value across a time interval.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CDT_DBT_BAL_TRXN_SPIKE = F * R^2
Where:
R = (N_TOT_CR_TRXN_AM – N_TOT_DR_TRXN_AM) / (N_TOT_CR_TRXN_CT + N_TOT_DR_TRXN_CT)
F = IN_SHORTEST_TIME_CNSECTY_TRXN / AVG_TIME_CNSECTY_TRXN

⸻

GTMS & FCSO Red Flag - TRXN_CT_SPIKE

Business Requirement:
To detect an unusual spike in the number of transactions within a short time frame.

Technical Specifications:
Uses the shortest and average consecutive time gaps between transactions to detect concentration or burst patterns.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
TRXN_CT_SPIKE = 1 – (IN_SHORTEST_TIME_CNSECTY_TRXN / AVG_TIME_CNSECTY_TRXN)
