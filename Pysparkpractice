Hi Team,

This request is part of the Catalyst Migration Program.

As part of the integration testing prior to the upcoming migration — with freeze starting from July 19 and cut-over planned for August 16 — could you please upload a recently modified sample parameter or watchlist file via MFU into the designated NAS path on the new green server?

Kindly engage with Madhu after the upload, so she can verify the file’s presence and revert accordingly.

Please let us know once the file is uploaded, or if you need any additional inputs from our side.
