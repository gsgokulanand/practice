Key Timelines & Environment Dependencies (Newly Added):
	•	Sandbox provisioning is planned for early Q3 2025, which is critical for:
	•	End-to-end testing
	•	Tuning
	•	UAT sign-off
	•	Production data for Egypt is expected to be available by mid-July 2025, which will be leveraged for sandbox testing.
	•	Production deployment is planned for early Q4 2025, post UAT completion.
	•	These activities are aligned with prior practices (e.g., Phase 2B testing) where similar sandbox environments were used for other country rollouts.
