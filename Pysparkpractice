Hi Team,

We are seeing recon mismatches from the Secure, Secure 1, and Secure 2 source feeds with missing or failed partition dates. Since the OA (source) team communication is being handled via PSS, kindly share their response on these recon failures at the earliest.

If these unresolved partitions continue to roll into the next monthâ€™s ODS, it will directly impact the FSS AML BAU batch processing, which is already on hold due to this dependency.

Requesting your urgent support to follow up with OA and help us proceed with the batch without further delay.

Thanks,
Gokul
