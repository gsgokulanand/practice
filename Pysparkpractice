Hi Team,

As part of the ongoing support and maintenance of the FSS AML system, we have raised an EPIC to capture various Business-As-Usual (BAU) activities and minor technical enhancements planned over the next one year. The scope includes threshold file revisions, post-tuning activities, minor performance tuning, Catalyst migration support, and any ad-hoc fixes required for production stability.

Given the nature of the tasks, the risk involved is minimal, and there is no impact on DQMF revision. Therefore, we propose proceeding with this change under a lower GRAM rating.

We request your support to accommodate and proceed with this change accordingly.




Hi Team,

As part of ongoing system upkeep and performance alignment in FSS AML, we have created an EPIC to track multiple Business-As-Usual (BAU) activities and technical enhancements for the upcoming year. This EPIC is intended to consolidate minor, low-risk items that do not warrant DQMF revision or major impact assessment.

Scope of the EPIC includes the following:
	1.	Regular BAU Threshold File Revisions
	•	Post tuning activities and BTL feedback incorporation.
	•	Minor performance optimizations like normalization in the base module.
	2.	Catalyst Migration Support
	•	Although the main Catalyst migration is complete on the green server, a few environment-level activities are pending, such as:
• Enabling file permissions
• Modifying table properties
• Activating version control parameters in configurations
	3.	Ad-Hoc Fixes for Production Jobs
	•	Any urgent, non-invasive fixes required to maintain job continuity and avoid disruption in production flows.

Given the minor nature of these changes, we propose to proceed with a lower GRAM rating as the risk level is minimal and there’s no impact to DQMF.

Requesting your concurrence to move forward with the implementation under this category. Please let me know if you have any concerns or would like further details.
