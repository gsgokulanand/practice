ðŸ”¹ Environment & Timeline Plan
	â€¢	Sandbox Setup â€“ Target: Early Q3 2025
	â€¢	Critical for testing, tuning, and UAT sign-off
	â€¢	Effort expected: 2â€“3 months, factoring in Catalyst migration
	â€¢	Production data for Egypt will be available by mid-July, which can be used for sandbox testing
	â€¢	This setup was also used during Phase 2B testing and is considered part of the current change scope
