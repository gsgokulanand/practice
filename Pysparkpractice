Hi Wayne,

We have identified most of the source columns under the account domain. Following Subhashâ€™s suggestion, weâ€™ve also included a few additional CDD columns under this category, which were confirmed by you.

The relevant data has been populated in the shared sheet:
ðŸ“Ž Data Requirements for Unified CDD â€“ 20250625
Kindly review the updated sheet and provide any additional feedback or confirmation at your earliest convenience.

Things to Note:
	â€¢	In the notes section (Column K), some of the CDD columns need further investigation to confirm if they can be mapped using Mantas or any other CDD source systems.
	â€¢	The logical field names of all CDD columns will be reviewed later by Wayne.
	â€¢	We are currently working on the CDD unification based on the column set irrespective of the source system used
