1. Purpose of the Change:

“This change request is raised to support data migration from MANTAS AML Production to the PROD Sandbox environment. It’s primarily required for downstream analysis and reference in sandbox environments for 9 country datasets.”

2. Scope of Data:

“We are migrating 5 key tables relevant to the KDD module:
	•	KDD_BREAK_BINDING
	•	KDD_BREAK_MTCHS
	•	KDD_PTTRN
	•	KDD_REVIEW
	•	KDD_SCNRO
covering 9 countries: AE, DE, KE, GB, HK, NG, SG, MY, US.”

3. Data Volume and Duration:

“Data extraction will cover a 3-year window:
from 30 June 2022 to 30 June 2025,
based on prcsng_dt filters applied during the query execution in AIG script.”

4. Execution Plan:

“We will execute SQL queries with spool enabled to generate .DAT files for each table and country-specific view. This has already been scripted and tested in AIG.”

5. File Transfer Plan:

“The .DAT files will be securely copied from the local application server to the NAS destination path:

/CTRLFW/FCC_DM/sandbox/FCSO_CM

on the sandbox server hklpaphaa010.global.standardchartered.com.”

6. Validation & Safeguards:

“We have incorporated row count validation and checks for zero-byte files before copying.
We’ll also log the count of records extracted per view per country to ensure completeness.”

7. Impact Assessment:

“This is a non-intrusive read-only activity on MANTAS AML Prod data. No write operations or DDL changes are involved.
Data extraction will happen during off-peak hours to avoid performance impact.”

8. Rollback Plan:

“As it’s a read-only data pull, no rollback is required. In case of error during file generation or copy, the process can be rerun for individual views.”
