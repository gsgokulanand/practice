As part of the Catalyst Migration Program, we’re running integration tests ahead of the migration freeze on 19 July and the cut-over on 16 August.

Could you please upload a recently modified sample parameter or watchlist file via MFU to the designated NAS path on the new green server?

After the upload, kindly coordinate with Madhu so she can confirm the file’s presence and report back.

Please let us know once the file is in place, or if you need any additional details.
