ðŸ”´ 1. N_CUST_AGE

Business Requirement:
To flag cases where a customer uses an account for a short period. Younger customers (newly opened accounts) may pose a higher risk compared to seasoned customers.

Technical Specification:
This flag compares the age of the customerâ€™s account with the scenario execution date to identify new or recently onboarded customers.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CUST_AGE = cust_dt_diff (cust_act_dt - scenario_execution_date)

ðŸ”´ 2. TOTAL_AMT_IP_ZSCORE

Business Requirement:
To detect transaction behavior not aligned with a clientâ€™s declared nature of business or occupation.

Technical Specification:
Calculates the Z-score on inward personal (IP) transactions and compares it against the average and standard deviation of past 12 monthsâ€™ transactions.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
IP_ZSCORE = (N_TOT_TRXN_AM_N - N_AVG_TRXN_AM_IP) / N_SD_TRXN_AM_IP

â¸»

ðŸ”´ 3. TOTAL_AMT_LM

Business Requirement:
Identify clients whose current transaction volumes significantly exceed their historical limits.

Technical Specification:
This flag captures the highest transaction value for the customer and compares it with their monthly average over the last 12 months.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
TOTAL_AMT_LM = (N_TOT_TRXN_AM - N_LM_TRXN_AM_IP) / N_SD_TRXN_AM_IP

ðŸ”´ 4. WIRE_AMT_IP_ZSCORE

Business Requirement:
To identify unusual wire transaction patterns from individuals (IP) compared to expected norms.

Technical Specification:
Calculates the Z-score for inward/outward wire transactions (IP type), derived from WIRE_TRXN_AM tables.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
WIRE_IP_ZSCORE = (N_WIRE_TRXN_AMT - N_AVG_WIRE_TRXN_AMT_IP) / N_SD_WIRE_TRXN_AM_IP

â¸»

ðŸ”´ 5. WM_LM

Business Requirement:
To detect frequent or substantial wire transfers inconsistent with clientâ€™s business/occupation.

Technical Specification:
Compares the total current month wire transfer volume against last monthâ€™s values and computes deviation.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
WM_LM = (N_TOT_CR_TRXN_AM - N_TOT_DR_TRXN_AM)

ðŸ”´ 6. COT_DEBT_RATIO

Business Requirement:
To monitor clients receiving funds from offshore entities and spending them on high-value purchases like luxury items.

Technical Specification:
Calculates the ratio of incoming funds vs outflows toward flagged categories (like purchases).

Feature Pseudo Logic:
DEBT_RATIO = ROUND((OUTFLOW/INCOME)*100, 2)

â¸»

ðŸ”´ 7. N_SD_TRXN_AM_IP

Business Requirement:
To assess standard deviation in monthly inward transaction amounts from personal accounts over past 12 months.

Technical Specification:
Uses standard deviation to highlight abnormal variations in monthly incoming IP transaction amounts.

ðŸ”´ 8. N_WIRE_TRXN_AMT

Business Requirement:
To detect high-value wire transactions (sent or received) within the lookback period. Larger values may require scrutiny.

Technical Specification:
Sums up wire transaction values across the lookback window.

Feature Pseudo Logic:

ðŸ”´ 9. N_SD_WIRE_TRXN_CT_IP

Business Requirement:
To evaluate consistency or abnormal spikes in the count of wire transactions from personal accounts.

Technical Specification:
Uses standard deviation on wire transaction count over 12 months to find irregularities.

Feature Pseudo Logic:

ðŸ”´ 10. RATIO (R = N_TOT_CR_TRXN_AM - N_TOT_DR_TRXN_AM)

Business Requirement:
To identify imbalance between credits and debits; large mismatches could indicate suspicious account behavior.

Technical Specification:
Subtracts total debit transaction amount from total credit to get net movement.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
RATIO = (N_TOT_CR_TRXN_AM - N_TOT_DR_TRXN_AM)
