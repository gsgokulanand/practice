Hope youâ€™re doing well.

Just checking in to kindly request an update on the below item. During our previous discussion with Anna, there was an agreement to proceed with the revised cost for Korea, to be implemented through a two-phase (2-year) funding and work alignment plan.

We would also appreciate your guidance on the funding status for Taiwan, as this will help us plan the next steps accordingly.

Many thanks in advance for your support.
