Hi Haitham,

Thank you for your message.

We fully acknowledge the criticality of the timeline and are committed to supporting the successful rollout. Our team is currently working diligently to complete the dependent activities from our end — including the CRA assessment, data assessment, tuning, and SIT testing — with a target to close these by the first half of Q3.

While we are aiming to meet the July 2025 implementation deadline, we would like to highlight that the overall timeline may be subject to change depending on the completion of the above activities. That said, we are making every effort to stay on track and deliver within the expected timeframe.

We will continue to keep you updated on our progress and will promptly communicate any risks or challenges that may impact delivery.

Appreciate your continued support and understanding.
