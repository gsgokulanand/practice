Absolutely! Here’s an enhanced version of Story 2 and 3 with additional technical details like file transfer mode (JDBC) and column-level integration. You can directly plug this into your ECM epic or user stories section.

2. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Integration to transfer scored events from Quantexa to ECM
	•	Quantexa will push scored events to ECM via JDBC-based integration for near real-time ingestion.
	•	Each batch will include a table payload with fields such as:
Case_ID, Event_ID, Txn_ID, Country, Score, Rule_ID, Rule_Description, Event_Description, Event_Timestamp, and Customer_ID (total 10–12 columns).
	•	ECM will ingest this data into the pre-case layer for further processing and case enrichment.
	•	Handshake step must confirm batch completion between ECM and Quantexa.
	•	Errors or missing records must be logged and alerted through monitoring dashboards.

3. TM_Contextual Monitoring: Data feed from ECM to Quantexa
	•	ECM will send feedback to Quantexa using JDBC connection on a scheduled batch basis (e.g., daily).
	•	Feed will consist of a structured table with columns such as:
Case_ID, Status, Outcome, Reviewed_By, Review_Timestamp, Escalation_Reason, Remarks (around 7–8 columns).
	•	This loop enables feedback learning for future model enhancements in Quantexa (closed-loop enrichment).
	•	Handshake validation will ensure successful data transfer for every batch, with reconciliation against the expected count.
	•	Data feed failures must trigger alerts and retry attempts.

Let me know if you want to apply a similar enrichment for other stories too.
