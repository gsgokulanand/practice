1. Inclusion in the SS AML Tuning Calendar & BTL Capacity
Yes, we have already been liaising with the respective country teams and SPOT. Both markets are included in the tuning plan, and thresholds were finalised based on volume patterns and the country-specific model. The Egypt approval (attached earlier) also confirms agreement on these parameters. No capacity concerns have been highlighted by the BTL team for handling the additional cases once activated.

2. DQ Controls & Data SL Alignment
We have prepared the DQ controls in line with the standard framework used for other Group countries. The full DQA assessment for both Egypt and Saudi has been completed and covers all relevant scenarios. Future periodic reviews will be aligned to country approvals, and no impact is expected to the existing DQ control design.

3. AA Engagement, Training & DOI/Guidance Updates
For Egypt, AA operations will continue to be handled by the KL GBS team, who are already familiar with the BAU processes.
For Saudi, once the IGA is in place, the AA analysts will be onboarded and trained—this is expected well ahead of January 2026. We will involve the risk owner for any additional or country-specific training requirements, if needed. No challenges anticipated here.

4. GTMM & GRB Updates
Yes, updates will be made as part of the annual refresh cycle, following the technical go-live. This follows the standard process applicable for all market rollouts.

5. IGA Sign-off for Egypt & Saudi
For Egypt, a separate IGA is not required as investigations continue under the existing GBS AA setup.
For Saudi, the IGA is in the final stages and is expected to be completed before January 2026.

Please let me know if you require any further details. We remain aligned with the planned approach and do not foresee any impact to controls or readiness for the technical go-live.
