Thanks for the updated headers! Based on the image, here’s a revised and structured version of Feature #1 along with User Stories 1 to 4, aligned with the titles you provided:

Feature #1

TM Contextual Monitoring: Data Ingestion & Integration Setup from MANTAS to FCC LA Contextual Monitoring

Description:
As part of the Contextual Monitoring enhancement, this feature enables the foundational data ingestion and integration setup between MANTAS (Transaction Monitoring system) and FCC LA (Financial Crime Compliance – Link Analysis) Contextual Monitoring platform. The objective is to enrich TM alerts with contextual insights, including customer behaviors, relationships, and network patterns, to improve alert quality and risk detection.

User Story 1

TM Contextual Monitoring: Transaction Data Ingestion for FCC LA Contextual Monitoring

Description:
As a data pipeline engineer,
I want to ingest transaction data from MANTAS into FCC LA Contextual Monitoring,
So that the contextual engine can analyze behavior patterns and entity relationships for improved alert scoring.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Transaction data must be extracted from MANTAS with required fields.
	•	Data must be transformed and enriched as per FCC LA specifications.
	•	Ingested data should be successfully validated in FCC LA.
	•	Volume and quality thresholds must be met as defined in the ingestion SLA.

User Story 2

TM Contextual Monitoring: Integration Between MANTAS and FCC LA Contextual Monitoring

Description:
As a system integrator,
I want to establish seamless integration between MANTAS and FCC LA,
So that enriched contextual insights can be bidirectionally shared for enhanced monitoring and alert generation.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Data integration endpoints must be established and secured.
	•	API and batch data flows between MANTAS and FCC LA must be tested and validated.
	•	Successful round-trip data flow should be confirmed with sample alert scenarios.
	•	Integration should be performance-tested to meet production load requirements.

User Story 3

TM Contextual Monitoring: CDD Data Integration to FCC LA Contextual Monitoring

Description:
As a data engineer,
I want to ingest and integrate CDD (Customer Due Diligence) data into FCC LA,
So that risk factors, customer types, and behavior classifications can enrich contextual alerting.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	All required CDD fields must be sourced and mapped to FCC LA data model.
	•	Data must be validated for quality, accuracy, and freshness.
	•	Integrated CDD data should reflect in contextual analysis dashboards.
	•	Any missing or incomplete data points must be flagged via DQ rules.

User Story 4

TM Contextual Monitoring: DQ, Data Lineage Handshake

Description:
As a data quality analyst,
I want to define DQ rules and ensure data lineage tracking between MANTAS and FCC LA,
So that data integrity, traceability, and compliance with regulatory audits are maintained.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	DQ rules (completeness, accuracy, timeliness) must be implemented on incoming data streams.
	•	Data lineage mapping must be documented from source to contextual output.
	•	Alerts must be generated for DQ breaches and fed into monitoring dashboards.
	•	Periodic DQ reporting must be scheduled and reviewed by FCC governance teams.
