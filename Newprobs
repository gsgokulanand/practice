Background and Problem Statement:

The current MANTAS TM system operates on a rules-based alert generation mechanism, which often lacks contextual intelligence. This leads to high volumes of low-value alerts, increased analyst workload, and suboptimal risk identification, especially in complex transactional environments.

With rising regulatory expectations and the evolving nature of financial crimes, there is a pressing need to enhance the TM system’s risk detection capabilities by introducing Contextual Monitoring. This enhancement uses network analytics and enriched data via Quantexa to provide a more comprehensive view of customer behavior and relationships.

Key challenges being addressed:
	•	High False Positives: The current system generates a large number of alerts that do not lead to actionable cases.
	•	Limited Risk Visibility: Alerts are evaluated in isolation, without insight into broader network activity or entity relationships.
	•	Operational Scalability: Manual triaging of alerts becomes inefficient and inconsistent across markets.

Implementing Contextual Monitoring will help mitigate these issues by automating the end-to-end flow from event scoring to case creation in ECM, improving detection, prioritization, and operational efficiency in the existing AML framework.
