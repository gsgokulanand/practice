Background and Problem Statement:

The current MANTAS TM system operates on a rules-based alert generation mechanism, which often lacks contextual intelligence. This leads to high volumes of low-value alerts, increased analyst workload, and suboptimal risk identification, especially in complex transactional environments.

With rising regulatory expectations and the evolving nature of financial crimes, there is a pressing need to enhance the TM system’s risk detection capabilities by introducing Contextual Monitoring. This enhancement uses network analytics and enriched data via Quantexa to provide a more comprehensive view of customer behavior and relationships.

Key challenges being addressed:
	•	High False Positives: The current system generates a large number of alerts that do not lead to actionable cases.
	•	Limited Risk Visibility: Alerts are evaluated in isolation, without insight into broader network activity or entity relationships.
	•	Operational Scalability: Manual triaging of alerts becomes inefficient and inconsistent across markets.

Implementing Contextual Monitoring will help mitigate these issues by automating the end-to-end flow from event scoring to case creation in ECM, improving detection, prioritization, and operational efficiency in the existing AML framework.

Background and Problem Statement

The current MANTAS AML system operates on a traditional, rules-based alert generation mechanism that often lacks contextual intelligence. This leads to high volumes of low-risk alerts, increased manual triaging, and suboptimal risk identification — especially in complex transactional environments.

With evolving regulatory expectations and the increasing complexity of financial crime, there is a growing need to enhance the Transaction Monitoring system’s detection capabilities. The proposed enhancement introduces Contextual Monitoring using Quantexa’s entity resolution and network analytics to deliver a more connected and comprehensive view of customer behavior and relationships.

This approach enables improved risk detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and ensures better prioritization of truly suspicious activities.

Key challenges being addressed:
	•	Limited Risk Visibility: Current alerts lack insights into network connections and behavioral patterns.
	•	High False Positives: A large number of alerts do not result in actionable cases, burdening investigation teams.
	•	Operational Inefficiency: Manual triaging of alerts is inconsistent and resource-intensive across markets.
