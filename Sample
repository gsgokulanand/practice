As discussed during our last meeting, please find below the latest status of the FSS AML implementation activities for Saudi Arabia:

⸻

Implementation Update:
	•	The target go-live is planned for Q3 2025, in alignment with the overall FSS AML rollout strategy.
	•	We have successfully completed the data assessment phase for the Saudi region.
	•	The team is currently working on the completion of configuration and setup-related activities, including rule onboarding, parameter setup, and environment validation.
	•	Kindly confirm whether the client data in the Secure source system is now fully available, or if there are any pending client migrations that we should be aware of before proceeding to the functional go-live stage.
	•	Please also confirm if the thresholds and parameter configurations for Saudi are expected to follow the Oman (OM) model, or if there are any specific deviations or localization needs to be considered.
	•	Post confirmation and completion of the setup, we will schedule and facilitate scenario training sessions for country users as part of the go-live preparation.
