Hi Team,

Sharing below a consolidated cross-market summary of insights based on CCAML and MANTAS data for the period Aug’25 to Dec’25, covering all in-scope markets. The summary addresses case volumes, customer segmentation, correlation with MANTAS events, and risk-relevant outcomes.

⸻

1. Case Volume – Last 5 Months (Aug’25 to Dec’25)
	•	Across all markets, a total of ~7,800 CCAML cases were generated over the five-month period.
	•	Case volumes remain relatively stable month-on-month, with expected seasonal or market-specific variations.
	•	A small number of markets (e.g., HK, VN, MY, SG) contribute a larger share of overall volume, while other markets operate at significantly lower absolute volumes.

Insight:
CCAML case generation is concentrated in a few high-volume markets, which drives the overall portfolio trend.

⸻

2. Standalone Credit Card Customers
	•	Across all markets, approximately 6% of total CCAML cases relate to standalone credit card customers.
	•	The remaining ~94% of cases involve customers with broader banking relationships (e.g., CASA-linked).
	•	The presence of standalone credit card customers varies by market:
	•	Some markets show minimal or zero standalone card exposure
	•	A small number of markets (e.g., HK, BN) contribute the majority of standalone card cases

Insight:
Standalone credit card customers represent a minority of the overall CCAML population across markets.

⸻

3. Correlation with MANTAS AML Events
	•	Across all markets, ~9% of CCAML cases are correlated with MANTAS AML events.
	•	Conversely, ~91% of CCAML cases remain uncorrelated with MANTAS and are investigated independently.
	•	Correlation levels differ by market:
	•	Some markets exhibit low single-digit correlation
	•	A few smaller markets show higher percentages, driven by low absolute volumes rather than scale

Insight:
At a portfolio level, correlation with MANTAS events remains limited and non-dominant.

⸻

4. Risk-Relevant (RR) Outcomes – Correlated vs Standalone
	•	Risk-relevant (RR) case closures are observed across both:
	•	CCAML cases correlated with MANTAS events
	•	Standalone CCAML cases (including standalone credit card customers)
	•	Across markets:
	•	The percentage of RR cases arising from MANTAS-correlated CCAML cases is low
	•	A significant proportion of RR outcomes continue to originate from non-correlated CCAML cases
	•	There is no consistent pattern indicating that MANTAS correlation alone materially increases RR conversion rates across markets.

Insight:
Risk relevance is not exclusively driven by MANTAS correlation and continues to be identified through standalone CCAML investigations.

⸻

Conclusion
	•	CCAML case volumes are concentrated in a small number of markets, with stable trends over the last five months.
	•	Standalone credit card customers form a small proportion of the total CCAML population across markets.
	•	The majority of CCAML cases (~90%) are investigated without correlation to MANTAS AML events.
	•	Risk-relevant outcomes are observed across both correlated and non-correlated cases, indicating that effective risk detection exists independently within CCAML.
