16. Stress Testing & Performance Benchmarking
	•	Simulate high-volume transaction loads to assess system stability.
	•	Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize processing times.
	•	Ensure the system meets predefined performance SLAs under peak conditions.

17. Data Consistency & Integrity Checks
	•	Validate that transaction records remain consistent across MANTAS, Quantexa, and ECM.
	•	Implement automated scripts to detect and flag data discrepancies.
	•	Ensure data integrity through reconciliation processes.

18. Negative Testing & Error Handling Validation
	•	Test system behavior under unexpected conditions (e.g., incomplete data, invalid formats).
	•	Ensure proper error logging and alert mechanisms for failed transactions.
	•	Validate the effectiveness of retry mechanisms and fallback procedures.
