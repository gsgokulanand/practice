This feature computes the maximum number of credit transactions between external counterparty name pairs. It includes both:
	‚Ä¢	Primary beneficiaries where originator account and augmentation name are present, and internal flags are not set.
	‚Ä¢	Secondary beneficiaries identified by secondary originator details and exclusion of internal flows.

The logic is applied on data from WIRE_TRXN and MI_TRXN, with union of both beneficiary types. Grouping is done by external party name combinations to detect high-frequency counterparties.

üîÅ Pseudo Logic (Concise & Clear):

FROM (
  UNION of:
    - Primary: valid orig_acct_id + orig_aug_nm, not internal
    - Secondary: valid scnd_orig_acct_id + SCND_ORIG_AUG_NM, not internal
)
GROUP BY (cdt_cntr_party_nm_ext, cdt_scnd_cntr_party_nm_ext)
