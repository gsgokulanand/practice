Story 1: TM_Contextual Monitoring : CDD Source Systems Analysis

Description:
As part of the unified CDD integration for FCC LA Contextual Monitoring, a comprehensive analysis of all source systems is required to understand the structure, ownership, update frequency, and availability of Customer Due Diligence (CDD) data. This analysis will help identify the fields that can be used to enrich contextual scoring models and behavioral monitoring logic. The focus is to ensure completeness and relevance of data coming from the following nine systems:
	â€¢	iCDD BA
	â€¢	DCUBE BA
	â€¢	CuPID III BA (Detokenized data)
	â€¢	Individual Client Master BA
	â€¢	SCI BA
	â€¢	ClientCentral BA
	â€¢	EBBS
	â€¢	Moodyâ€™s Orbis (Corporate Registry)
	â€¢	Veritas (internal + external watchlist)

Acceptance Criteria:
	â€¢	A system-wise summary document must be created listing key fields, data owners, and update frequency.
	â€¢	All 9 CDD systems should be included with clear data availability status.

âœ… Story 2: TM_Contextual Monitoring : Unified CDD Schema Definition

Description:
Define a unified CDD schema that consolidates customer, account, and entity-level attributes sourced from various BA and strategic systems. This schema will serve as the standardized data input to Quantexa and contextual monitoring platforms, ensuring consistency and traceability. The schema must include identifiers, risk classifications, residency indicators, KYC attributes, and industry-specific metadata.

This story involves stakeholder alignment with Quantexa, FCC teams, and Data Governance stakeholders to finalize the schema.

Acceptance Criteria:
	â€¢	Unified schema must cover all required customer and entity-level attributes.
	â€¢	Final schema must be reviewed and signed off by Quantexa, ECM, and relevant data owners.

ðŸ”§ Task 1: TM_Contextual Monitoring : Field-Level Mapping Tracker Creation

Description:
Build and maintain a tracker to map source fields from each of the nine CDD systems to the unified schema. The tracker should include field name, data type, transformation rules, nullability, data owner, and any business logic applied. This task supports traceability and transparency in the CDD data onboarding process.

ðŸ”§ Task 2: TM_Contextual Monitoring : Data Gap Analysis & Quality Review

Description:
Review the extracted data from each source system to identify missing fields, inconsistent values, null rates, formatting issues, and outdated data. Document all gaps and engage respective system owners to discuss resolution plans, rule-based fixes, or temporary workarounds. Prioritize fields critical for Quantexa scoring logic.

ðŸ”§ Task 3: TM_Contextual Monitoring : Quantexa CDD Schema Readiness Check

Description:
Validate the final unified schema against Quantexaâ€™s ingestion requirements. Ensure all mandatory fields for entity resolution and scoringâ€”such as party type, risk rating, country of incorporation, and industry codeâ€”are mapped and available. Work closely with Quantexa SMEs to confirm compatibility with their model ingestion logic and ensure no key data is missed.

ðŸ”§ Task 4: TM_Contextual Monitoring : Batch Volume & Frequency Estimation

Description:
Estimate expected batch volumes and ingestion frequency (daily, weekly) for CDD data across systems. This task supports sizing, platform readiness, scheduling needs, and transformation planning. It will also be used to evaluate whether JDBC pipelines or flat file loads are optimal for each source.

ðŸ”§ Task 5: TM_Contextual Monitoring : Sandbox Load & Initial Validation

Description:
Coordinate with platform and integration teams to load sample datasets from selected CDD sources into the FCCLA sandbox environment. Validate record formats, volume, transformation logic, and schema compliance. Perform reconciliation between source and loaded data and log all observations and issues.
