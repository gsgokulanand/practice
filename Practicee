Please find below the detailed overview of the resource and team allocations for the Korea and TW initiatives:

⸻

Korea Project:
	•	As per the attached email, the overall delivery will span 2 years, from November 2025 to October 2027, covering both development and implementation phases.
	•	Technical activities will be handled by the Korea Tech team.
	•	AA process will be managed in-country.
	•	While development is set to begin in late 2025, key Ops and Tech resources are being onboarded earlier to support planning, setup, and initial alignment.

Recommendation (Korea):
We recommend onboarding key resources within 2025 to support foundational planning and knowledge setup. However, major implementation efforts and budget allocations can be primarily planned for 2026 when development activities ramp up.

⸻

TW Project:
	•	The AA process will be managed by the GBS Ops team.
	•	Technical tasks will be owned by the FCSO GBS Tech team.
