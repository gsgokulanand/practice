Please find below the detailed table of resource/team allocations.

For Korea, as per the attached email, the entire project will span over 2 years — i.e., from development to implementation (Nov 2025 to Oct 2027). The technical activities will be handled by the Korea tech team, while AA processes will be managed in-country.

For TW, the AA process will be managed by the GBS Ops team, and technical tasks will be carried out by the FCSO GBS tech team.

Let me know if any clarifications are required.
The Korea implementation is scheduled to start in November 2025, and the overall delivery will span across two years (Nov 2025 – Oct 2027). While the development activities will begin in late 2025, key resources (both Ops and Tech) are being onboarded in 2025 to ensure early planning, setup, and initial alignment.
