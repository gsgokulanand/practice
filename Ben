Background and Problem Statement:

The current MANTAS system operates on traditional, rules-based alert generation, which results in high volumes of low-risk alerts and increased manual triaging. This limits the system’s ability to effectively identify complex or hidden financial crimes.

To address this, the Contextual Monitoring enhancement uses Quantexa’s entity resolution and network analytics capabilities to provide a more comprehensive and connected view of customer transactions and behaviors. By scoring events based on contextual factors, the solution significantly improves risk detection accuracy and relevance.

Key issues being addressed:
	•	Limited Detection Accuracy: Rules-based alerts often miss subtle risk patterns or connections between entities.
	•	High Analyst Workload: Excessive false positives overwhelm operational teams.
	•	Lack of Contextual Intelligence: Existing alerts lack the relationship and behavioral insights needed for deeper investigations.
