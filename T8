üî∫ GTMS & FCSO Red flag ‚Äì CASH_AMT_RATIO

Business Requirement:
To identify structuring behavior where customers intentionally keep transactions below a certain threshold (typically cash deposits/withdrawals) to avoid triggering regulatory reporting or scrutiny.

Technical Specifications:
This feature calculates the ratio of cash transactions over total transaction amount. A high ratio may indicate attempts to avoid reporting obligations by using cash-intensive operations such as cheques, LoCs, BoEs, etc.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CASH_AMT_RATIO = (N_CASH_TRXN_AMT) / (N_TOT_TRXN_AMT)
(Derived from cash transaction amount and total transaction amount from counterparty accounts)

üî∫ GTMS & FCSO Red flag ‚Äì CDT_DEBT_BAL_TRXN_SPIKE

Business Requirement:
To detect sudden spikes in debt-credit transactions which might indicate irregular or suspicious movements, possibly as a way to manipulate balances or clear obligations quickly.

Technical Specifications:
This flag monitors spike behavior by computing the transaction volume compared to past averages. A spike is flagged if the current balance shows rapid increase over short periods.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CDT_DEBT_BAL_TRXN_SPIKE = F * R^2
Where:
R = (N_TOT_DR_TRXN_CT + N_TOT_CR_TRXN_CT) / TOT_TRXN_CT
F = 1 / SHORTEST_TIME_CNSECTY_TRXN

üî∫ GTMS & FCSO Red flag ‚Äì CIB_TRXN_AMT

Business Requirement:
To monitor total amount of CIB transactions executed by the customer. High amounts within a short period could indicate abnormal or high-risk activities.

Technical Specifications:
This metric captures the total CIB volume transacted by the focal entity. High values are reviewed for potential irregularities.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
CIB_TRXN_AMT = SUM(trxn_amt_cib)

‚∏ª

üî∫ GTMS & FCSO Red flag ‚Äì N_TOT_TRXN_DEBT_AMT

Business Requirement:
To assess the overall debt amount moved through transactions in the lookback period. A spike here could indicate risky financial movements or attempts to clear liabilities suddenly.

Technical Specifications:
This feature sums the total debit amount (outflows) across all transaction types by the focal entity.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
N_TOT_TRXN_DEBT_AMT = (N_TOT_TRXN_AMT_OUT + TRXN_DEBT_ADJ)
(Based on inputs from cash flow fields in the transaction layer)

‚∏ª

üî∫ GTMS & FCSO Red flag ‚Äì N_CASH_TRXN_AMT

Business Requirement:
To track the total value of cash transactions sent/received. Excessive cash-based activity could be an indicator of structuring or concealment of transaction origins.

Technical Specifications:
This metric calculates the total amount transacted in cash, both incoming and outgoing, by the focal entity.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
N_CASH_TRXN_AMT = SUM(CASH_IN_AMT + CASH_OUT_AMT)

‚∏ª

üî∫ GTMS & FCSO Red flag ‚Äì N_ML_TRXN_DEBT_CT

Business Requirement:
To track the number of high-value debit transactions potentially linked to money laundering risk.

Technical Specifications:
This metric counts the number of transactions with a debit purpose marked as ‚ÄúML‚Äù or fitting a predefined list of suspicious categories.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
N_ML_TRXN_DEBT_CT = COUNT(trxn_id WHERE purpose IN (ML_LIST))

‚∏ª

üî∫ GTMS & FCSO Red flag ‚Äì TRXN_CT_SPIKE

Business Requirement:
To identify a sudden spike in transaction count which may suggest attempted structuring, layering, or other suspicious behavior.

Technical Specifications:
This compares the number of transactions in the shortest time window against the average. If the count exceeds the baseline threshold, it‚Äôs flagged.

Feature Pseudo Logic:
TRXN_CT_SPIKE = 1/N * (SHORTEST_TIME_CNSECTY_TRXN / AVG_TIME_CNSECTY_TRXN)
